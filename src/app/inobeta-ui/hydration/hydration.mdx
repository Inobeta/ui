# Hydration

Use the `ibSetupHydration` function to setup a persisted state. Provide a unique key for your state and
the keys of other stores present in your app that you wish to save on the browser's storage.

It is recommended to provide the following keys on your application:
- `ibHttpState`: holds user authentication data
- `ibViews`: table views created by the user
- `ibTable`: *Legacy table* set of features

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { EffectsModule } from "@ngrx/effects";
import { StoreModule } from "@ngrx/store";
import { ibSetupHydration } from "@inobeta/ui";

const appStorage = ibSetupHydration("app-storage", [
  "ibHttpState",
  "ibViews",
  "ibTable",
]);

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, {
      metaReducers: appStorage.metareducers,
    }),
    EffectsModule.forRoot([
      TableEffects,
      ...appStorage.effects,
      ...ibHttpEffects,
    ]),
  ],
  /** ... */
})
export class AppModule {}
```
