# HTTP Overview

## Setup

This modules comes with an application wide store, and is required to provide it's features.

- First import `IbHttpModule` in your `AppModule`
- Then add `ibhttpReducers` to your map of reducers
- Lastly, apply the effects provided in `ibHttpEffects`

```typescript
import { IbHttpModule, ibHttpReducers, ibHttpEffects } from "@inobeta/ui";

const reducers = {
  ibHttpState: combineReducers(ibHttpReducers),
  // ...
};

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    /** ... */
    IbHttpModule,
    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers),
    EffectsModule.forRoot([...ibHttpEffects]),
  ],
  declarations: [
    /** ... */
  ],
  providers: [
    /** ... */
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Basic features

Besides offering services and directives, this module provides other out-of-the-box features such as:

- Authentication interceptor
  - Sets the `Authentication` header for every HTTP requests
- Error interceptor
  - Shows error messages if an HTTP request returns an error
- Loading interceptor
  - Counts and tracks any pending HTTP request to properly show loading indicators within your app

## Directives

### Loading directive `ibLoading`

Directive to conditionally display a loading skeleton or the original content based on the loading state.

```html
<section *ibLoading="{ size: 4 }">Hello ðŸ‘‹</section>
```

<Story of={loadingStories.loadingDirective} />

By default, the content will be replaced during any HTTP request currently in progress.  
To provide a specific endpoint to listen to, add the `endpoint` parameter

```html
<section *ibLoading="{ endpoint: { url: '/api/data', method: 'GET' } }">
  <!-- ... -->
</section>
```

**Parameters:**

```typescript
{
  /** Number of skeletons to display */
  size: 1,
  // Width applied to each skeleton. "rand" will randomize their width
  width: "rand",
  /** Height of each skeleton */
  height: "20px",
  /** Custom CSS class applied to each skeleton */
  className: "",
  /** Specific endpoint, can be undefined */
  endpoint: { url: '/path/to/resource', method: 'POST' },
}
```

### Role directive `ibRoleCheck`

Directive to conditionally render content based on user roles.

```html
<section *ibRoleCheck="['admin', 'workspace_admin']">
  <!-- Content only visible for users with 'admin' or 'workspace_admin' roles --->
</section>
<section *ibRoleCheck="['user']">
  <!-- Fallback for regular users -->
</section>
```

## Components

### Spinner loading

Display a spinner loading animation while HTTP requests are in progress.

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<ib-spinner-loading />
```

## Route Guards

### IbAuthGuard

Guard routes based on user authentication.

Usage:

- Include the `IbAuthGuard` in the `canActivate` route guard to protect routes.
- If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the login page provided by the `ibHttpGUILoginUrl` token.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "dashboard",
    component: DashboardComponent,
    canActivate: [IbAuthGuard],
  },
  // ... other routes ...
];
```

### IbLoginGuard

Guard routes based on user login status.  
The opposite of IbAuthGuard, the route will activate if the user is **NOT** authenticated

Usage:

- Include the `IbLoginGuard` in the `canActivate` route guard to protect routes.
- If the user is authenticated, they will be redirected to a page provided by the `ibHttpGUIDashboardUrl` token

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "login",
    component: LoginComponent,
    canActivate: [IbLoginGuard],
  },
  // ... other routes ...
];
```

### IbRoleGuard

Guard routes based on user roles.

Usage:

- Include the `IbRoleGuard` in the `canActivate` route guard to protect routes based on user roles.
- Specify the required roles in the route's data property.
- If the user is not granted access, they will be redirected to a page provided by the `ibHttpGUIDashboardUrl` token

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "admin",
    component: AdminComponent,
    canActivate: [IbRoleGuard],
    data: { roles: ["admin"] },
  },
  // ... other routes ...
];
```

## Decorators

### ibCrudToast

Method decorator for displaying toast notifications, and optionally navigating back after a CRUD operation.

**Parameters:**  
- enableBackCall: Indicates whether to navigate back after the operation.
- successMessage: The success message to be displayed in the toast notification. (i18n)
- timeoutOnSave: Time in milliseconds to wait before navigating back (if enabled).

```typescript
@ibCrudToast(true, 'users.edit.success', 500)
handleSave() {
  // ... your save logic ...
  return someObservable;
}
```
